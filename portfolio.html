    <h1>   CSP Football emulates a real-life penalty shootout in soccer. The player first sees the welcome screen, and has to press "y" to continue. Next, the player is allowed to choose a direction, left/right and up/down to shoot the ball. The Computer dives the goalie in a random direction, and depending on the outcome, your score goes up by 1 or stays the same. The same thing is done in reverse: you must save a direction to choose, and the computer kicks the ball in a random direction. The computer's score goes up by 1 or stays the same. This is repeated 5 times, like a real-life penalty shootout. You win if you score more points than the computer.
